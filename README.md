<h2><b><u><p id='Jupyter'>Running Jupyter Notebook</p></b></u></p></h2>

<br>

The easiest way to run the notebooks is by python installed via the Anaconda distribution. 
Anaconda is the most widely used python distribution in data science fields as it comes preloaded with most of the most popular packages and tools. You can find out more about Anaconda and how to install it here
  https://docs.anaconda.com/.

<br>

You can forgo downloading Anaconda and install each package individually in the python shell. A full list of requirements for each notebook can be found in the `requirements.txt` file in this repository. Full details and links to each package used can be found further down in this README.
