# spotify-history-data-analysis

### Files relating to problem sets for Programming and Scripting

As a avivd music fan and listener, I wanted to explore and incorporate this into a project.                                  
The aim of this project is to research and investigate my personal Spotify listening history, doing so by writing documentation and investigate the data using Python.

Please see the jupyter notebook for futher explaination
